MacFeegle Prime
===

This repo is for the [PiWars](www.piwars.org) entry [MacFeegle Prime](https://neave.engineering/2019/10/11/macfeegle-prime-overview/)!

This is a [Raspberry Pi](www.raspberrypi.org) based robot, themed on Johnny Five from Short Circuit.  Granted, with a Discworld flavour to it...

After all, don't you wonder what would have happened if Johnny Five, seeking input, stumbled upon the Nac Mac Feegle mound?

Crivens!
